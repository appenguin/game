# PenguinSki

Penguin downhill ski game inspired by Ski or Die (EA, 1990). PWA + Capacitor. No backend.

> **Note:** `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file (`AGENTS.md`). Edit `AGENTS.md` directly.

## What this is

A penguin slides downhill on ice. Steer left/right to dodge obstacles (rocks, trees). Hit ramps to launch into the air. Perform tricks mid-air (flips, spins) for bonus points. Land cleanly or crash. Collect fish. Survive as long as possible.

Inspired by **Ski or Die** (EA, 1990) -- especially the Downhill Blitz and Acro Aerials events. Top-down scrolling, arcade feel, trick scoring.

## Tech stack

- **Phaser 3** game framework
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for bundling
- **Strudel** (`@strudel/web`) for procedural music
- **Capacitor** for Android APK wrapping

No backend. All data stored locally (localStorage / Capacitor Storage).

## General guidelines

- When suggesting changes to a file, prefer breaking them into smaller chunks
- Never tell the user "you're absolutely right" or similar affirmations
- Act autonomously on reversible changes; ask before changing scoring logic or game feel
- Keep core game logic in `src/core/`, platform-independent
- Keep Phaser-specific code in `src/engine/`
- Platform adapters in `src/platform/` (web vs Capacitor)

## Constraints

- Offline-first: PWA with service worker already precaches all assets (vite-plugin-pwa)
- Touch-first controls with on-screen steer + trick buttons, keyboard as secondary. Input priority: keyboard > touch. Portrait orientation locked.
- Must run at stable FPS on mid-tier Android
- No remote code loading (App Store requirement)
- Bundle all assets inside the app for Capacitor builds

## Controls

- **Steering:** Arrow keys or A/D (keyboard), LEFT/RIGHT buttons or tap screen halves (touch). Angle-based with momentum; steering reduces downhill speed via `cos(heading)`. Ice patches reduce turn rate and increase drift.
- **Wing control (speed):** Up/W = spread wings (brake, +60 drag). Down/S = tuck wings (speed up, 0 drag). Neutral = 10 drag. Works on ground; tuck also works in air (changes sprite).
- **Air trick:** Space/Enter or TRICK touch button. Single "Flip" trick (300 pts), once per jump. Spin with Left/Right while airborne.
- **Landing:** Clean = full points with combo; sloppy = no points; crash = no points + combo reset.
- **Menus:** Arrow keys + Enter/Space navigate all menus (Doom-style). ESC pauses/resumes. R = retry, Q = quit. Touch also works. Tap HUD bar to pause on mobile. Pause menu: Resume / Quit. Game over menu: Retry / Quit.
- **Cheat:** +/= teleport forward 100m, -/_ teleport back 100m. Zeroes score, camera flash, advances music + storm.
- **Mobile layout:** `[<] [▼ TUCK] [★ TRICK] [>]` single row at bottom.

## Camera and rendering

- Procedural snow texture background (128×128 TileSprite, scrolls with world at depth -10)
- Penguin sprite sheet (2 frames: tucked/open wings) at screen center; world scrolls via `camera.scrollX`
- Trees are sprite-based (4 variants from `tree-sheet.png`, randomly selected, 2.2x scale, depth 7 — above penguin at depth 5)
- Rocks are sprite-based (4 variants from `rock-sheet.png`, randomly selected, 3.5x scale, depth 7)
- Ramps are procedural graphics (trapezoid with shadow, slope lines, lip highlight — generated texture at runtime, 1.6x scale, depth 6)
- Ice ponds are irregular polygons (8-12 random vertices around an elliptical path, unique shape each spawn)
- Other obstacles use procedural shapes (ellipses, circles)
- Snow spray particles + belly-slide trail behind penguin on ground; trail pauses inside trees
- Tree collision: continuous snow burst (white particles from tree + under penguin) while overlapping, tree shakes ±3px around origin, speed penalty scaled by hit centeredness
- **3 lives** (🐧🐧🐧 in HUD): rock hit flings penguin off-screen (tween: spin, shrink, fade), respawn at center with 2s invincibility flash. Camera freezes during fling. Final death on last life
- Obstacles persist after being hit (marked with `hit` flag to prevent re-triggering); only fish are removed on collection
- Event particle bursts on collisions and landings; camera bump on landing
- Snowstorm at 1500m: 500 screen-fixed snowflake circles (`setScrollFactor(0)`) with organic wind gusts (160 px/s max); wind pushes penguin and obstacles laterally (5× push when airborne); white overlay reduces visibility; +30% air time during storm; ramps up over 100m
- UI pinned to screen with `setScrollFactor(0)` on each element individually (not via container, which breaks Phaser touch hit testing): HUD bar, buttons, menus

## Depth layering

| Depth | Element |
|-------|---------|
| -10 | Snow background TileSprite |
| -1–0 | Ski trail marks |
| 3 | Snow spray, ice sparkle, snowdrift puff |
| 4 | Penguin shadow |
| 5 | Penguin (ground), burst emitters at 6 |
| 7 | Trees |
| 8 | Penguin (airborne) |
| 9 | Storm snowflakes, storm overlay |
| 10–11 | HUD bar, text |
| 20 | Touch buttons |
| 50–51 | Menu overlays |

## Speed physics

Force-based model: speed changes each frame based on forces, clamped to difficulty cap.

```
gravity      = 120            (constant downhill pull)
friction     = speed * coeff  (normal 0.15, ice 0.03, snowdrift +0.25)
wingDrag     = 0 / 10 / 60   (tuck / neutral / spread)

accel = gravity - friction - wingDrag
speed += accel * dt
speed = clamp(speed, 0, cap)
```

## Difficulty levels

Three player-selected levels on the start screen:

| Level | Start speed | Cap |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Easy | 150 | 350 |
| Medium | 200 | 500 |
| Hard | 280 | 600 |

Speed is no longer a function of distance — it emerges from the force model. Players control speed via wing tuck/spread. Ice patches reduce friction (fast acceleration). Snowdrifts add extra friction drag.

Trees are the most common obstacle (40% at easy, 25% at expert). Tree collision uses acceleration-based slowdown: grazing = -30 speed, dead center = -300 speed (near full stop). Resets combo.

Obstacle spawn difficulty (distance zones 0-3) is separate and unchanged by level selection.

## Scoring

- **Distance:** slow trickle from forward movement
- **Fish:** +10 pts on collection
- **Trick (Flip):** 300 pts × combo on clean landing
- **Spin:** 100 pts per half rotation on clean landing
- **Ice:** 25 pts × combo, increments combo (chains with tricks)
- **Icy Jump:** hit ramp while slippery → +50% air time, 2× trick score on clean landing ("ICY COMBO")
- **Flyover:** 50 pts × combo for flying over rocks or trees while airborne
- **Combo:** increments on clean trick landings and ice patches; resets on crash or tree hit

## Music

Procedural layered music powered by **Strudel** (`@strudel/web`). Samples loaded from `github:tidalcycles/dirt-samples`.

- 15-level progressive arrangement (0-14) driven by distance (meters), not score — instruments enter one at a time
- Starts with Bmin9 triangle chord pad, builds through sawtooth bass, drums (bd, hh, sd), ghost snares (TR-909), saw leads with `arrange()` cycling, bass progressions, to full solo at 1500m
- Key: B minor. Tempo: BASE_BPM 140, per-difficulty: Easy 110, Medium 124, Hard 140 BPM (fixed throughout game)
- Level changes quantised to 4-bar boundaries for musical coherence
- On init, the full arrangement plays silently (`gain(0)`) for 500ms to preload all samples
- Pattern definitions live in `src/core/music.ts` — edit that file to change the music
- Music system (`src/engine/systems/Music.ts`) is a singleton shared across scenes
- Music toggle on boot screen, preference persisted in localStorage
- AudioContext created synchronously inside native DOM gesture handler (`pointerdown`/`keydown`), then injected into superdough via `setAudioContext()` before `initStrudel()` runs. This bypasses Strudel's built-in `initAudioOnFirstClick()` which only listens for `mousedown`
- Phaser audio disabled (`noAudio: true` in game config) — all audio goes through Strudel. Re-enable when adding Phaser sound effects

## How to play

- **Choose your difficulty** -- Easy, Medium, or Hard -- each with different speed and acceleration
- **Steer** with arrow keys, A/D, or the on-screen LEFT/RIGHT buttons -- the penguin rotates and carves in that direction
- Hold a direction to build momentum; release to drift back straight
- Hit **ramps** to launch into the air
- **Perform tricks mid-air** with keyboard directions or the **FLIP** and **TUCK** buttons
- **Land cleanly** to keep your score, crash and lose your combo
- Collect **fish** for points
- Avoid **rocks** and **trees**
- Speed increases over time -- survive as long as you can
- The **top bar** shows your score, distance, speed, and difficulty level

**Mobile:** Install to your home screen for fullscreen portrait play. Four buttons at the bottom: **< TUCK TRICK >** -- steer with the arrows, tuck to speed up, trick while airborne. Tap **| |** in the top bar to pause.

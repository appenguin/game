## How to play

- **Steer** with arrow keys, A/D, touch screen sides, or **tilt your phone**
- Hit **ramps** to launch into the air
- **Tap directions mid-air** to perform tricks (flips, spins) for bonus points
- **Land cleanly** to keep your score, crash and lose your combo
- Collect **fish** for points
- Avoid **rocks**, **trees**, and **crevasses**
- Speed increases over time -- survive as long as you can

**Mobile:** Install to your home screen for fullscreen play. Tilt steering gives analog control -- slight tilt for gentle turns, big tilt for sharp ones.
